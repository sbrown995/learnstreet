Welcome! Here is a Bubble Sort project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

Write a simple algorithm to efficiently perform a sort on an array of numbers. Maybe not the most efficient way to sort a large set of numbers, but a bubble sort is one of the basic exercises of computer science.

Try it out!
